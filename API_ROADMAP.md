# Education Data Cleaning Tool - API Integration Roadmap

This document outlines the planned API integration roadmap for the Education Data Cleaning Tool, which currently operates as a native-first offline desktop application. The future API integration will enhance the application's capabilities while maintaining its core offline functionality.

## Current State: Native-First Offline Application

- Fully functional offline desktop application for macOS and Windows
- Complete data import/export functionality for CSV and Excel formats
- Local-only duplicate detection and data cleaning
- Independent operation without requiring any internet connectivity

## Phase 1: API Foundation (Future)

- **Implement API Configuration UI**
  - Enhance the existing Settings dialog
  - Add secure credential storage
  - Test connectivity with the API server
  
- **Basic API Integration**
  - Implement student record validation against central database
  - Support basic authentication and authorization
  - Add error handling and retry logic
  - Maintain offline fallback for all operations

- **Testing**
  - Utilize the `future_api_tester.py` utility to validate API endpoints
  - Implement automated tests for API communication
  - Ensure proper error handling for network issues

## Phase 2: Enhanced API Features (Future)

- **Cloud Synchronization**
  - Two-way sync of cleaned data with central server
  - Conflict resolution for data discrepancies
  - Background synchronization with pending changes queue
  
- **Centralized Duplicate Detection**
  - Leverage server-side duplicate detection algorithms
  - Cross-dataset duplicate identification
  - Machine learning enhancements for fuzzy matching

- **Batch Processing**
  - Support for large dataset processing through the API
  - Progress tracking and resumable operations
  - Efficient data chunking for optimal performance

## Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Future)

- **Analytics and Reporting**
  - Centralized reporting dashboard
  - Historical data analysis and trends
  - Customizable export formats
  
- **Collaborative Features**
  - Multi-user access to shared datasets
  - Role-based permissions
  - Real-time collaboration capabilities
  
- **Integration with Other Systems**
  - Support for third-party education management systems
  - Standardized data exchange formats
  - Extensible API for custom integrations

## User Satisfaction Measurement

Throughout all phases of API development, we will:

- Collect anonymous usage metrics (opt-in only)
- Gather user feedback on API features and performance
- Measure success rates for online operations
- Track user adoption of online vs. offline features
- Continuously improve based on user satisfaction data

## Implementation Notes

- The application will always maintain 100% offline functionality as its core feature
- All API features will be implemented with offline fallbacks
- User data privacy and security will remain a top priority
- API integration will focus on enhancing, not replacing, existing features
